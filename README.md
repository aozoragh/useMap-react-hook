"# useMap-react-hook"

Use the useState() hook and the Map constructor to create a new Map from the initialValue.
Use the useMemo() hook to create a set of non-mutating actions that manipulate the map state variable, using the state setter to create a new Map every time.
Return the map state variable and the created actions.
